# Spring Scala

The goal of Spring Scala is to make it easier to use the Spring framework in Scala.

Currently, the two main areas of focus are:

* Wiring up Scala classes as Spring Beans, both in traditional [XML](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-scala/wiki/Defining-Scala-Beans-in-Spring-XML) as well as [Scala](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-scala/wiki/Functional-Bean-Configuration)
* Provide [Scala-friendly](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-scala/wiki/Using-Spring-Templates-in-Scala) wrappers for the Spring templates

For more information, please refer to the [documentation on the wiki](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-scala/wiki)

## Installation

As of writing this, there are no binaries to download.
We plan to release a first milestone soon.

## Building

Spring Scala is currently using Maven, but a Gradle build is being worked on.
For the moment, you can build Spring Scala as follows:

    git clone git@github.com:SpringSource/spring-scala.git
    cd spring-scala
    mvn install
